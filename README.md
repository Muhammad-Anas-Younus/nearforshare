# NearForShare

❌ Problem!
We’ve all used AirForShare, right? Especially as university students — it’s super handy in labs for quickly sharing things like lab manuals, code files (🙈), or quick notes with friends nearby.

But there’s one big catch…

You must be on the same Wi-Fi network. That’s fine in some cases — but what if you’re in a university lab where the computers are wired and not connected to the same network as your phone or laptop? Suddenly, AirForShare becomes unusable.

You just want a quick, frictionless way to drop a file or some text from one device and access it on another nearby, regardless of the network.

And sure, you could open WhatsApp Web, email, or another messaging app on the lab computer — but that’s a privacy and security risk. Logging into personal accounts on public or shared machines isn’t safe, and most of us know better than to leave our sessions open on lab PCs.

✅ Solution
NearForShare is a privacy-conscious, network-independent way to share text and files with nearby devices.

Instead of relying on Wi-Fi networks, it uses your device’s approximate location (with your permission) to drop content in a virtual space. Anyone nearby can instantly see and access what you dropped — no shared network, no account login, no hassle.

It’s like AirForShare — but smarter and safer:

📍 Location-based sharing: Drop files or messages tied to your current location so nearby users can access them.

🛡️ No account needed for public sharing, keeping things fast and simple.

🚫 No personal account logins on shared/public devices — you stay secure.

📂 Text or file support: Drop a quick message or upload documents and images.

🧭 Clean, distraction-free UI that works well on desktop and mobile.

NearForShare is built for environments like university labs, classrooms, co-working spaces, cafes, and conferences — any situation where you want to share something quickly with nearby people, safely and without setup friction.
