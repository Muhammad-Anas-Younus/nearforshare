# MVP

- ability for users to upload files and text (let's call it drops)
- ability to see nearby drops (location based, within a certain radius [mid to large room])
- limit number of drops per area (only a certain amount of drops can be uploaded at a time within a certain radius, if users want to upload more drops then they will have to delete previous ones, or maybe automatically replace previous drops like airforshare does it ?)
- ability to delete drops if decided to go with delete approach in the above step
- limit the size of uploaded files to 5MB
- automatically delete uploaded drops after 30 mins
- apply rate limiting to prevent abuse
- make frontend secure (xss and other security concerns of the frontend)

# AFTER MVP

- user registration and subscription for upgraded file sizes (50 - 100MB ?)
- add subscription or maybe a one time fee that would allow customers to upload very large files (in GBS)
- limit the total number of GB'S per account and based on subscription tier (eg: 50GB for standard, 100GB for above standard etc)
- ability to create folders and upload files inside that folder
- ability to share files/folders via different mechanisms (one time link, link that expires after a certain time, password protected links)
- ability to create workspaces
- ability to add different people to workspaces via an email invite and give them different level access (READ, WRITE, ADMIN)
- limit the number of workspaces and the number of people per workspace based on different tiers of subscription
